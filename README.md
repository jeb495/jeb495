# Hey

Im doing homebrew and some low level programming, with a bit of web development thrown in there from time to time

### Disclamer: 
Some stuff on my github is not owned by me. There is usually credit given but sometimes I am lazy. Most of it is tools and utilities that were not already on github. I have a habit of modifying existing open source software to fit my needs, so some of that is hosted here too.
