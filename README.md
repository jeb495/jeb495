## Hey ðŸ‘‹

Im doing homebrew and low level programming 

### Disclamer: 
Some of the stuff in my repo's is not owned by me. There is usually credit given but sometimes I am lazy. Most of it is tools and utilities that were not already on github. I have a habit of modifying existing open source software to my needs, so some of that is hosted here too.
